#### sc diff is the <strong>first</strong> shortcut to replicate the <code>git diff</code> function in/for Apple Shortcuts to display changes between two versions of a shortcut.

This repo contains a collection of action identifiers (<code>WFWorkflowActionIdentifier</code>) and their respective actions in Apple Shortcuts.

Actions are listed in key-value pairs where the key is the <code>WFActionIdentifier</code>(found in a shortcut's .plist file) and the value is the action as it is listed in the Shortcuts UI. Apps are split into three (3) categories&#8212;"Native Shortcuts Actions", "Third-Party Apps", and "Apple Apps". Actions are contained inside their respective Apps. 

This list is non-exhaustive and is updated periodically. <strong>**It contains only FREE apps. No paid apps are listed.**</strong>
