#### sc diff is the <strong>FIRST</strong> shortcut to replicate the <code>git diff</code> function in/for Apple Shortcuts and display changes between two versions of a shortcut.

This repo contains a collection of action identifiers (<code>WFWorkflowActionIdentifier</code>) and their respective actions in Apple Shortcuts (formerly Workflow).

Actions are listed in key-value pairs where the key is the <code>WFActionIdentifier</code> (found in the .plist file) and the value is the action as it is listed in the Shortcuts UI. Actions are contained inside their respective Apps, and apps are split into 3 categories&#8212;"Native" for native Shortcuts actions, "Third-Party Apps" for apps where the developer is <strong><u>not</u></strong> Apple, and "Apple Apps" for apps where the developer <strong>is</strong> Apple. 

This list is non-exhaustive and is updated periodically. <strong>**It only contains FREE apps. No paid apps are listed.**</strong>
